# Personal Identifiable Information (PII) Scanner

## Overview
The **Personal Identifiable Information (PII) Scanner** is a Python-based utility designed to enhance data privacy and security by detecting sensitive information in text files. It identifies various PII types, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, and social security numbers, using advanced pattern matching techniques. The tool also provides actionable insights to help users mitigate privacy risks.

## Features
- **PII Detection**: Identifies sensitive data such as names, emails, phone numbers, and social security numbers using regex patterns.
- **PII Score Calculation**: Computes a risk score based on the type and quantity of detected PII.
- **Visualization**: Displays results via interactive bar charts and gauge indicators using Plotly and Matplotlib.
- **Audit Logs**: Maintains a log of scan results for analysis and auditing.
- **User-Centric Design**: Ensures user consent before scanning, promoting ethical data handling.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for implementation.
- **Regex**: For pattern matching to identify PII.
- **Matplotlib & Plotly**: For data visualization and score representation.
- **SQLite**: To store scan results for further analysis.
- **Logging**: For creating detailed logs of the scanning process.

## How It Works
1. **Consent-Based Scanning**: The user grants permission before initiating a scan.
2. **File Handling**: Scans the specified text files for PII.
3. **PII Identification**: Detects sensitive information using predefined regex patterns.
4. **Score Calculation**: Quantifies the risk based on detected PII.
5. **Visualization**: Generates visual insights through bar charts and gauge indicators.
6. **Recommendations**: Provides actionable advice based on the PII score.
